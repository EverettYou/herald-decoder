# Wiki Lint

Check both what can be validated mechanically and what requires scientific judgment. Lint reports problems; it does not erase disagreements to make the wiki look consistent.

## Workflow

1. Read `wiki/SCHEMA.md` and [references/lint-rules.md](references/lint-rules.md).
2. Run:

   ```bash
   python3 skills/wiki-lint/scripts/lint_wiki.py <project-root>
   ```

   Add `--semantic` for the optional OpenAI-backed knowledge-health review. This mode loads
   `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the project `.env`, uses `OPENAI_SEMANTIC_LINT_MODEL` (falling back
   to `OPENAI_MODEL` and then `gpt-5.6-luna`), and caches strict structured results under
   `.tmp/`. Use `--semantic-limit N` for a bounded smoke test and `--semantic-refresh` only
   when the same evidence should be reviewed again intentionally.

3. Review structural findings: required files, page-format fields, broken or ambiguous Markdown/Obsidian links, including claim citations in the portable `[readable label](relative-path#locator)` form, missing indexed pages, orphan compiled pages, duplicate titles, malformed `sources.yml` entries, and malformed log entries. Reject citation syntaxes that require a source-ID resolver. Check that sources resolve outside `wiki/`, completed labs are registered, and project summaries link to the resources that own their details. Treat math-layout warnings as actionable: displayed equations must not use manual horizontal-spacing commands such as `\quad` or `\qquad`, and no display-math source line may exceed 110 characters.
4. Audit semantic health: unsupported claims, contradictions hidden by overwrites, stale thesis statements, concepts mentioned repeatedly without pages, missing inverse links where useful, registered sources that did not change durable synthesis, and high-value gaps. The semantic mode supplies bounded page, neighbor-summary, and provenance packets to the model. Treat every finding as a review candidate rather than established fact.
5. Classify each finding as error, warning, or research opportunity. Cite exact paths and ask the user to decide findings requiring scientific judgment, ambiguous merges, or prioritization.

## Fix boundary

Automatically fix only clearly mechanical problems when the user asks: index omissions, link spelling, formatting, or missing reciprocal navigation. Do not automatically resolve scientific contradictions, merge concept pages with distinct meanings, change confidence, or rewrite the thesis. Route substantive corrections through `$wiki-ingest` with source evidence.

## Completion

Report structural status, knowledge-health findings, source coverage, and the highest-value maintenance or research actions as a numbered list with suggested fixes. A zero-error structural result does not imply that the wiki is scientifically complete.

Semantic findings do not change the command exit status and never modify the wiki. API or configuration failures do return a distinct failure because an explicitly requested review did not complete. Token usage is appended to `.tmp/llm-usage.jsonl` without credentials or source text.
